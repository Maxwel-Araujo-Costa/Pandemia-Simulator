PSRC - Pixel Sprites ala Reactorcore

*This package is part of a library of pixel game art sprites.
All packages under the PSRC series have been designed to be consistent, flexible, customizable, clear and easy to use.

*All sprites follow the same global 1m = 40px rule, where the standard height of a human being is 60px or 1.5m, a scale standard, on which all the sprites have been based on.

*All sprites are consistent in style, scale, shading and are zoomable up to 600%, meaning it will look good up to 6 times the original size before the individual pixels begin to be noticable and thus look blocky aesthetically. 

*These graphics are intended for video game use.

*The pack provides two usable formats for the sprites:
1. An optimized power-of-two(256px) atlas sheet.
2. A folder that contains each object from the sheet as an individual image.

*The infosheet is meant only as a reference, while the optimized sheet and the individual images are meant for actual use.

*The specific scale I decided on is based on research I made for the best possible 2D sideview game that takes into account the ability to zoom in/out, be lightweight, fast to develop, have enough detail to be clear what it is and look cool.

*There is usually a greyscale template and a default color version of each sprite. Choose which format suits your project the best.

*Each package has the potential to get free updates for up to 3 sheets worth of sprites total.

*Be sure to check out the free starter pack that includes a generous amount of content (over 230 unique items!) enough to make a full game with.

*The sprites were created using Jasc Paint Shop Pro 9 and sliced with Alferd Spritesheet Unpacker. The style and mass production framework was developed by me.

*I hope you will make great games and that my sprites can help you with it. Remember to treat the player with respect. :)

*You can send screenshots of your game that uses these sprites and I may feature them in the screenshots for the packs, with a link to your site to promote the game.
